v0.0.1:
+ Writing code with reusability in mind
+ Search match precision
+ Search vice-versa
+ Support for exact matches, eg. Interpreted "Thomas Eugene", which should match "BASIC", but not "Haskell"
+ Match in different fields, eg. Scripting Microsoft should return all scripting languages designed by "Microsoft"
+ Support for negative searches, eg. john -array, which should match "BASIC", "Haskell", "Lisp" and "S-Lang", but not "Chapel", "Fortran" or "S".
